* Joining asakusa.rb
{{mail(blaz.hrast@gmail.com,1415328476)
Hi, my name is Bla“] Hrastnik from Ljubljana, Slovenia (Europe). I'm just
arrived to Tokyo on a tourist visa for 90 days. I used to work primarily in
ruby, one of my larger projects was Dawn (https://github.com/dawn/dawn
<https://github.com/dawn/dawn)>) which then got me my current job, I work
for Flynn (flynn.io) as a backend developer in Golang.

I do not speak much Japanese, but I've been trying to learn in the past few
months.

So yeah, I hope to become a regular attendee of asakusa.rb for the next few
months :)

Sure, thank you :) I'll make sure I'm at the station on time, I think
I have a direct route with the Yamanote line (I'm in north Shinjuku).
