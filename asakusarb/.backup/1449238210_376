みんな様、

Ruby Taiwanの竜堂です

Thanks you all Asakusa.rb guys entertained me and my colleague very well last month :)

I and my colleagues will fly to Tokyo this Saturday for attending RubyKaigi, and so far I did not find any Asakusa.rb’s official pre-party like former years.

Will you hold any meet-up or pre-party next Tuesday? We are loving to join :)

Thank you,

hi.

We don't have plan for pre-party, but we will do regular meet-up in ESM
office.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
