## Joining asakusa.rb

## Nov 7, 2014 From: blaz.hrast@g...

Hi, my name is Bla“] Hrastnik from Ljubljana, Slovenia (Europe). I'm just  
arrived to Tokyo on a tourist visa for 90 days. I used to work primarily in  
ruby, one of my larger projects was Dawn ([https://github.com/dawn/dawn](https://github.com/dawn/dawn)  
\<[https://github.com/dawn/dawn)](https://github.com/dawn/dawn))\>) which then got me my current job, I work  
for Flynn (flynn.io) as a backend developer in Golang.

I do not speak much Japanese, but I've been trying to learn in the past few  
months.

So yeah, I hope to become a regular attendee of asakusa.rb for the next few  
months :)

Hi, Bla“]!

Welcome to Japan, and to Asakusa.rb :)

Our meetup this week is going to be held tomorrow evening, at this place in  
Ueno [http://www.esm.co.jp/company/outline/tokyo\_map.html](http://www.esm.co.jp/company/outline/tokyo_map.html)

So, can we meet here in Ueno Station at 7:30 PM, then walk to the venue  
together? [http://bit.ly/lets-meet-here](http://bit.ly/lets-meet-here)

Sure, thank you :) I'll make sure I'm at the station on time, I think  
I have a direct route with the Yamanote line (I'm in north Shinjuku).
